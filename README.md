# ExploratoryData-Project-Coursera
This assignment project is from Exploratory Data Analysis from coursera (WEEK 01)


#When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

1. The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
2. We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather 3. than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
4. You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the \color{red}{\verb|strptime()|}strptime()  and \color{red}{\verb|as.Date()|}as.Date() functions.
5. Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as \color{red}{\verb|?|}?.
